What: Packet Thrower client and server

Why: This tool was initially used to dnamically control
     packet flows for stress testing network workloads

How to use these tools.
0. Run pt-server on 2 networked systems. pt-server takes a port number
   as argument. 
   Example pt-server 6666

1. Use pt-ctl-client to command each system to listen for packets
   on a port.
   Example: pt-ctl-client 192.168.1.180 6666 'lsn,5555' 
            pt-ctl-client 192.168.1.170 6666 'lsn,5555'

2. Use pt-ctl-client to command each system to throw packets of a 
   particular size at a target IP and port.
   Example: pt-ctl-client  192.168.1.180 6666 'snd,6400,192.168.1.170,5555'
            pt-ctl-client  192.168.1.170 6666 'snd,6400,192.168.1.180,5555'
